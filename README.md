# Dineflow-Database-Management-System-
A database project for managing restaurant operations with a payment-first ordering model.

### Overview
DineFlow is a restaurant ordering system designed to manage operations for restaurants that follow a **payment-first model** — where customers select menu items, pay at the cashier, and only then is the order created. This system suits **fast-casual restaurants, cafeterias, food courts**, and **quick-service** establishments.

### Business Model
**Payment-First Workflow:**
1. Customer browses menu  
2. Selects items  
3. Proceeds to cashier  
4. Payment is processed  
5. Order is created after successful payment  

Unlike traditional restaurants where orders are placed before payment, DineFlow ensures order creation only after transaction confirmation, supporting both **cash** and **card** payments.

### Scope of the System
The database system handles:
- Employee management with multiple role structures  
- Categorized menu catalog management  
- Customer registration and tracking  
- Payment processing (cash and card)  
- Order creation and fulfillment  
- Basic reporting and analytics  

### Development Insight
This project explores the complete process of building a **Database Management System (DBMS)** — from user analysis and data modeling to the implementation of a functional system.  
The **EER design and database logic** were developed with the support of AI tools to simulate realistic restaurant workflows and entity relationships. Through this project, I gained practical understanding of **end-to-end DBMS design**, including conceptual modeling, relational mapping, and SQL implementation.
