# DineFlow - Database Management System

DineFlow is a database project I’m working on to manage restaurant operations, specifically using a **payment-first ordering model** — where customers pick their food, pay first, and only then the order gets created. It’s the kind of setup you’d usually see in fast-casual restaurants, cafeterias, or food courts.

The idea is to build something that feels practical but also helps me understand how everything in a restaurant system connects from employees and menus to payments and reports.

### Business Model

The concept is simple:

1. Customer browses the menu
2. Chooses items
3. Goes to the cashier
4. Makes the payment
5. The order is created only after the payment goes through

It’s a bit different from the usual dine-first-pay-later setup. This one focuses on a cleaner, faster workflow.

### Scope

The system covers things like:

* Managing employees with different roles
* Handling menu items by category
* Registering and tracking customers
* Processing both cash and card payments
* Creating and fulfilling orders
* Generating basic reports and analytics

### Development Notes

I’m still working on this project and improving it as I go. I’ve been using AI tools to help me figure out the logic, design the EER, and write SQL, but the main goal for me is to actually understand how it all works. I also get feedback from my professor to fix and improve parts of the design so it’s a mix of experimenting, learning, and refining.

Basically, this project is my way of learning how a database management system comes together from start to finish — starting with user analysis, designing the structure, and then building something functional.

### What’s in this repo

* `DineFlow - Project Overview and User Needs Analysis.pdf` → my notes on user needs and the functions used in the system
* Entity-Relationship Diagram → visual of how the entities connect
* SQL Scripts → database schema, functions, procedures, and triggers
